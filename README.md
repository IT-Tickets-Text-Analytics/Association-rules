# Association-rules
Association rules aim to provide a decision support to a process worker in a form of task sets recommended based on the incoming ticket. The association rules are applied using the R arules package to determine possible sets of task types and subtypes (rule body) based on various contextual information in the rule head: (i) ticket type, (ii) ticket type and Decision-Making Logic (DML) of the ticket activity, (iii) ticket type, DML, and Business Sentiment.
